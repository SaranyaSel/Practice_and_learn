    <p>
      switchMap is similar to mergeMap, but it will cancel the previous inner observable when a new value is emitted.
      switchMap A is running, and switchMap B is emitted, then switchMap A will be canceled and switchMap B will be executed.</p>
      switchMap operator will cancel/unsubscribes the previous inner subscription and create a new inner subscription.
      Memory leak perspecive, if the inner Observable wouldn't complete, that's not a problem because each new value emitted by the source Observable cancels the previous inner Subscription.
      Memory leaks not dangerous.
      IT has only one active inner subscription at the same time and its always the one for the latest value emitted by the source Observable.
      This operator is good for its responsiveness as it doesn't wait for the previous inner subscription to finish before starting a new one for the latest value emitted by the source Observable.
      Quick reaction to new source values.
      Order mostly safe and predictable as the most recent value emitted by source.
