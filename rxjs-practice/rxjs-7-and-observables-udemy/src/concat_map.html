    <p>
      concatMap is similar to mergeMap, but it will wait for the previous inner observable to complete before
      subscribing to the next one.
      concatMap A is still running, and concatMap B is waiting for concatMap A to complete.
      when concatMap A not completed then it will be struck in the first observable.

      concatMap operator will queue the incoming values and as soon as the previous inner subscription completes, it
      will handle the next value in the bugger and create a new inner subscription.
      Memory leaks easy to notice.
      Values handled one by one. Previous subscription will be completed before emitting the new one.
      So its safest one.
      Possible delayed reactions.
