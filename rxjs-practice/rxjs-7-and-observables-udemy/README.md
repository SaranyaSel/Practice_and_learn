udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/rxjs-and-observables recomends stackblitz setup or this code setup https://github.com/JerryDoubleU/rxjs-playground but here the vite setup seems much simpler

```
    npm init --yes
    # change to "type": "module",
    npm add rxjs
    npm add --save-dev vite typescript
```

Add the script to package.json

````
"scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
```

Add index.html and index.ts
and run demo and watch the console
